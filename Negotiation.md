## Advices

- Aim high <a href="#a25">[25]</a>
- Be fair: “Good negotiators should always think about how they can show the proposal they're making is fair to both parties,” <a href="#a25">[25]</a>
- Diversify
- Have a bigger list - give up the nickels for the dimes <a href="#a26">[26]</a>
- Have everyone agree on a mathematical formula to value an asset or service, Then when you start plugging in the variables, that’s where the real negotiation is occurring and if you know in advance that those numbers are going to be lower than thought, then you will win the negotiation AND everyone will be happy when it’s over <a href="#a28">[28]</a> <a href="#a26">[26]</a>
- Sleep late - Carl Icahn, one of the best investors in the world, uses this technique: He schedules his negotiations for the early evening, sleep until 4pm and then go to the negotiation at 6pm. Our peak mental ability (according to Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational, and many other books) is approximately 2 hours after we wake up until about 4 hours after we wake up. <a href="#a26">[26]</a>

## Tips & Tricks

When we move every potential acquisition to the “it would be nice”, it means we know we have the power to walk away from a negotiation at any point. When we’re negotiating for a “it would be nice” item, we’re tapping into logic and keeping most emotions—those things that make us act in goofy and unpredictable ways—at bay. It turns us from suckers to deal makers because we become more patient, self-assured and less likely to look for the quick fix. [12]

Want to know how strongly you or your counterpart wants something? Put a number on it. A number 1, for example is neutral, and 10 would be something you can’t live without. Hopefully this will lead to both parties eventually comprising or coming up with an alternative. This has allowed me in the past to be very direct with the other party in letting them know what I’m not willing to leave on the table. [13]

Tell a story. Negotiators have an easier time controlling their expressions when they’re talking. So don’t ask too many open questions. Instead describe what you want or share an anecdote about another negotiating partner who shared concerns similar to theirs and watch how they respond as they listen. Their guard will lower a little and you’ll be able to see their honest reactions to what you’re saying — knowledge to guide the rest of the conversation. [14]

As soon as you ask for a specific deal—10 percent off, \$50 off—you set a limit... If you make it clear you’re looking to save but don’t say anything specific, it allows the salesperson the space to come up with their own creative way to help you. [15]

count to three or five in your head before you respond to anything. [17]

An indaba is designed to allow every party to voice its opinion, but still arrive at a consensus quickly. It works because opinions and arguments can only be aired in a particular way... Instead of repeating stated positions, each party is encouraged to speak personally and state their “red lines,” which are thresholds that they don’t want to cross. But while telling others their hard limits, they are also asked to provide solutions to find a common ground. [18]

...say the statement: “It seems like there’s nothing you can do.” People do not like to feel powerless, what it does is it makes the other side feel like they might be somewhat powerless. They’re going to want to search for answers. And certainly for someone higher than you in the hierarchy, the last thing they want to look to you, a subordinate, is to look powerless. It threatens their identity and authority. They’re not going to be comfortable saying yes to that. [19]

Be fair. "Good negotiators should always think about how they can show the proposal they're making is fair to both parties," Korobkin says. "Fairness" does not have one exact definition, but social psychology studies suggest that an offer people consider fair is one that is similar to what other people in the same situation are getting, consistent with market prices or terms, or on par with a similar transaction you have made in the past... [20]

Strike a power pose. Psychologists have found that expansive, open postures ("high-power poses") make people feel more powerful and confident during stressful situations such as interviews or negotiations, whereas closed, curled-in positions ("low-power poses") do the opposite... [20]

Aim high. Really high. Business research shows that people with more aggressive (but still realistic) goals—say, getting a 20 percent raise at work versus a 5 percent bump—end up doing better in negotiations. "One big reason for that is that people who have more aggressive goals make more aggressive first offers," Korobkin says. "Where you start has a lot to do with where you end up." This is called the "anchoring effect..." [20]

Use active listening:
Listen to what they say. Don’t interrupt, disagree or “evaluate.”
Nod your head, and make brief acknowledging comments like “yes” and “uh-huh.”
Without being awkward, repeat back the gist of what they just said, from their frame of reference.
Inquire. Ask questions that show you’ve been paying attention and that move the discussion forward. [21]

Time also plays a role. In negotiations, the side with the most time generally has an advantage. Patience pays. No matter how pressed you are, you should always keep your cool, maintaining an appearance of calm. "Your deadline is of your own making," Cohen writes. Don't ignore deadlines, but don't follow them blindly, either. [22]
